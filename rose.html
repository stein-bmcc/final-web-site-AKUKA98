     <h2>Rosé wines can be anywhere from syrupy sweet to bone dry. Older Rosé varieties produced in France and Spain will generally be quite dry, while newer Rosé wines will often have more sweetness.</h2>
        <p>Champagne rosé, being a sparkling wine from the Champagne region of France, often comes with a premium price due to the region's reputation and the traditional method of production.</p>
        <ul>
           <li>While pale pink rosés tend to be drier in style and darker rosés are typically sweeter and fruiter, colour alone can't determine the sweetness level in your wine.</li>
               
            <p>Rosé wines are perfect for sipping on their own or pairing with light summer dishes</p>
