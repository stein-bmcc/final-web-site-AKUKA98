        <h2> The colour can be straw-yellow, yellow-green, or yellow-gold.</h2>
        <p> It is produced by the alcoholic fermentation of the non-coloured pulp of grapes, which may have a skin of any colour. White wine has existed for at least 4,000 years.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>White wines are often used as an ap√©ritif before a meal, with dessert, or as a refreshing drink between meals</li>
       <p>White wines are often considered more refreshing and lighter in both style and taste than the majority of their red wine counterparts. </p>
