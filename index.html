      <h2>French wine originated in the 6th century BC with the colonization of Southern Gaul by Greek settlers. The Roman Empire licensed regions in the south of France to produce wines.</h2>
        <p>Over the course of its history, the French wine industry would be influenced and driven by the commercial interests of the lucrative English market and Dutch traders.</p>
        <ul>
           <li>There is archaeological evidence to suggest that the Celts first cultivated the grape vine, Vitis vinifera, in Gaul. Grape pips have been found throughout France, pre-dating Greek and Roman cultural influences, with some examples found near Lake Geneva being over 12,000 years old.</li>
            <li>Throughout its history, the French wine industry has been shaped by the influences of both external and internal forces. Three of the more prominent and pervasive influences came from the English/British people through both commercial interest and political factors, the Dutch who were significant players in the wine trade for much of the 16 and 17th century and the Catholic Church which held considerable vineyard properties until the French Revolution.</li>
